# Violence Detection System

Welcome to the Violence Detection System repository! This project aims to detect violence in video streams using deep learning techniques. By analyzing video footage in real-time, the system can identify potentially violent situations and alert appropriate authorities for timely intervention.





# Features

- Real-time Detection: Analyze video streams in real-time for potential instances of violence.
- Alerting System: Alert authorities or designated individuals when violence is detected.
- Customizable Thresholds: Adjust detection thresholds and parameters to suit specific requirements.
- User-friendly Interface: An intuitive web interface for easy interaction and monitoring.

## Tech Stack

- Python: Programming language used for backend development and machine learning.
- Flask: Web framework used for building the application.
- OpenCV: Library for computer vision tasks, such as video processing.
- Deep Learning Models: State-of-the-art neural networks for violence detection.
